To use put something like the following in your .emacs
    (require 'shen-mode)
    (require 'inf-shen) ; <- for interaction with an external shen process

Shen-mode.el is now included in the GNU ELPA http://elpa.gnu.org/ and
may be installed in new versions of Emacs using M-x list-packages.

Inf-shen.el is not yet in the GNU ELPA (pending FSF copyright
paperwork), until such time as it is incorporated into ELPA
inf-shen.el may be obtained from this git repository.
